        <p>Many QR code generators track your data, require signups, or add watermarks. We wanted a tool that would respect your privacy and be truly free to use.</p>
        <p>OpenQR was created to give you full control over QR code creation — with no data collection, no tracking, and no fees. Your QR codes are generated entirely in your browser.</p>
        <p>We believe privacy is a right, not a luxury. That’s why we built OpenQR with these core principles in mind.</p>
